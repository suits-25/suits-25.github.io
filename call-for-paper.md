Notification: Thu August 7, 2025<br>
Symposium dates: 22-25 September 2025<br>

———————————————————————-

## Scope

Symposium on Sustainable IT Systems (SUITS) will foster collaboration and knowledge exchange within the emerging and dynamic field of sustainable IT. To this end, the 4-day symposium will bring together scientists and PhD students to explore the interdisciplinary challenges of achieving sustainability in computing. 
SUITS provides a premier opportunity for young researchers (such as top graduate students, PhD students and PostDocs) working within the area to communicate and sharpen theirs research directions and discuss with top experts. SUITS is not a PhD symposium, but will have a focus on providing opportunities for young researchers.

As this area inherently spans multiple domains of computer science, the symposium will be the _premiere event_ to convene researchers from across the scientific community—spanning software engineering, systems, hardware, and networks—to spark new collaborations between previously disconnected fields.

We encourage PhD students, postdocs and other young researchers to contribute, but the symposium is open to all. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * energy aware programming languages and algorithms,
  * green coding and programming practice,
  * energy smells and code analysis,
  * green infrastructure sustainable design and technologies
  * low-power, distributed data processing on sensors
  * optimization and/or analysis in green computing and communications (including core network optimization),
  * green big data, cloud, and data center architecture,
  * energy harvesting communications and networks, and
  * computing affects to environment analysis and impact.
  * energy-efficient scalable computing infrastructures.
  * sustainable ICT applications: Grid, EV, Robotics, etc.


## Participation and venue
The purpose of SUITS is to bring together a varied group of experts and students to potential interaction and results for Sustainable IT Systems. The symposium has room for a limited number of participants (about 30). The organisation committee will, thus, make a selection based on relevance and quality of abstract, diversity of participants, and variation of academic level and fields.

The participation cost for SUITS is 2.000 DKK (about 270 EUR) covering hotel (three nights), social event, and all meals during the symposium. We can provide partial support grants for travel and other costs to participants with limited funding or extra needs; the application process will be detailed later.

## Submission guidelines
Researchers wishing to participate at SUITS are requested to submit short abstracts (maximum 800 characters) providing motivation and research direction for their work. You can expect readers to have knowledge about relevant background.
