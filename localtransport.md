## About Copenhagen

[https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/](https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/)

## Getting there from the airport
It takes just under an hour to get from the airport to the venue hotel.

There an no direct connection, but plenty of options with one or two changes, depending on your desire to walk.

You can always search the Rejseplanen app or Google Maps for convenient connections. But here are a couple.

### Metro and longer bus ride
At the airport go to the metro; from arrival walk straight and up the escalators. Take the metro (line M2, this is the only one) to Vanløse St. (the end station); about 25 minutes. At Vanløse St. take bus number 19 towards Glostrup St. Get of after about 25 minutes at the stop "Byparken (Hovedvejen)". This is just three stops before the end at Glostrup St.

### Regional train and local train
At the airport go the track 2 of the regional trains; from arrival walk straight, but at the end of the hall walk left or right down to track 2. Take any train to the main station (København H); depart every 10 minutes. (Don't take the trains to Sweden.) At the main station go to track 11 and 12; from here departs the local S-trans south. Take the B-line (green) towards Høje Taastrup St. Get off at Glostrup St. (8 stops, about 17 minutes).

From Glostrup station, you can either walk (1,4 km, 20 minutes) or take bus number 19 towards "Kongens Enghave Valbyparken" (it is end station, so there is only this direction) for 3 stops to "Byparken (Hovedvejen)".

### Metro and local train
If you would love to ride a self-driving metro, but hates the bus, you can take the metro (as above) but get off at Nørreport St. (9 stops, 15 minutes). From there you can take the local S-train B-line (as above) to Glostrup St.

This will be slight longer time, but not much.


## Getting there from the main station (København H)
Go to track 11 and 12; from here departs the local S-trans south. Take the B-line (green) towards Høje Taastrup St. Get off at Glostrup St. (8 stops, about 17 minutes).

From Glostrup station, you can either walk (1,4 km, 20 minutes) or take bus number 19 towards "Kongens Enghave Valbyparken" (it is end station, so there is only this direction) for 3 stops to "Byparken (Hovedvejen)".


## Local Transport
All local transport in Copenhagen can be used with the same ticket; i.e. the same ticket works for metros, buses, S-train (local), and regional trains on the rute. 

### Zones
Copenhagen is separated into zones. The price of a ticket is calculated based on the most zones you are away form your departure zone. Hence, not on the total number of zones you travel

Some examples:

  * Airport (Zone 4) to Centre (Zone 1): total of 3 zones! Regular price: 30 DKK.
  * Airport (Zone 4) to Glostrup (Zone 43) is 5 zones, though your will likely travel though 6 or more zones in total. Regular price: 44 DKK.
  * Centre (Zone 1) to Glostrup (Zone 43) is 4 zones. Regular price: 36 DKK.

  * Travel within Centre: 2 zones is the least you can buy. Regular price: 24 DKK.

To avoid all the of calculating zones and waiting in line to buy physical tickets, we recommend to use the DOT Ticket app; see below.

### Usefull apps:

* Rejseplanen; plan your local transport

* DOT Ticket; Buy tickets in an app; easiest if you just get a few.

* Rejsekort; Get an anonymous Rejsekort (Similar to London Oyster card); cheaper if you travel a lot. But a hassle to get, as you cannot get it at the airport.
