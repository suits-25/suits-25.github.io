## About Copenhagen

## Getting there from the airport
It takes just under an hour to get from the airport to the venue hotel.

There an no direct connection, but plenty of options with one or two changes, depending on your desire to walk.

You can always search the Rejseplanen app or Google Maps for convenient connections. But here are a couple.

### Metro and longer bus ride
At the airport go to the metro; from arrival walk straight to the end of the hall and up the escalators. Take the metro (line M2, this is the only one) to Vanløse St. (the end station); about 25 minutes. At Vanløse St. take bus number 19 towards Glostrup St. Get of after about 25 minutes at the stop "Byparken (Hovedvejen)". This is just three stops before the end at Glostrup St.

### Regional train and local train
At the airport go the track 2 of the regional trains; from arrival walk straight, but at the end of the hall walk left or right down to track 2. Take any train to the main station (København H); depart every 10 minutes. (Don't take the trains to Sweden from track 1.) At the main station go to track 11 and 12; from here departs the local S-trains south. Take the B-line (green) towards Høje Taastrup St. Get off at Glostrup St. (8 stops, about 17 minutes).

From Glostrup station, you can either walk (1,4 km, 20 minutes) or take bus number 19 towards "Kongens Enghave Valbyparken" (it is end station, so there is only this direction) for 3 stops to "Byparken (Hovedvejen)".

### Metro and local train
If you would love to ride a self-driving metro, but hates the bus, you can take the metro (as above) but get off at Nørreport St. (9 stops, 15 minutes). From the metro train walk left, up the escalator at the end. Follow the directions to Track 3-4 (a little straight and left up an escalator.) From Track 4 you can take the local S-train B-line (as above) to Glostrup St.

This will be slight longer time, but not much.


## Getting there from the main station (København H)
Go to track 11 and 12; from here departs the local S-trans south. Take the B-line (green) towards Høje Taastrup St. Get off at Glostrup St. (8 stops, about 17 minutes).

From Glostrup station, you can either walk (1,4 km, 20 minutes) or take bus number 19 towards "Kongens Enghave Valbyparken" (it is end station, so there is only this direction) for 3 stops to "Byparken (Hovedvejen)".


## Local Transport
All local transport in Copenhagen can be used with the same ticket; i.e. the same ticket works for metros, buses, S-train (local), and regional trains on the route. 

You _must_ always have a valid ticket before boarding public transport. Expect for busses (cach only), you cannot buy a ticket on the transport. If you don't have a valid ticket your will be fined 750 DKK.

There are regular checks, especially on the routes to and from the airport.

### Ticket valididy and zones
Copenhagen is separated into zones. The price of a ticket is calculated based on the most zones you are away form your departure zone. Hence, not on the total number of zones you travel.

Tickets are also valid for a given lenght of time based on the zones of the ticket. This is again for usage of any public transport in the zones that is at most X zones away of your starting zone.

Some examples:

  * Airport (Zone 4) to Centre (Zone 1): total of 3 zones! Regular price: 30 DKK. Valid for 1 hour 30 minutes.
  * Airport (Zone 4) to Glostrup (Zone 43) is 5 zones, though your will likely travel though 6 or more zones in total. Regular price: 44 DKK. Valid for 2 hours.
  * Centre (Zone 1) to Glostrup (Zone 43) is 4 zones. Regular price: 36 DKK. Valid for 1 hour 45 minutes.
  * Travel within Centre: 2 zones is the least you can buy. Regular price: 24 DKK. Valid for 1 hour 15 minutes.

To avoid all the of calculating zones and waiting in line to buy physical tickets, we recommend to use the DOT Ticket app; see below.


### A note on buses (yellow coloured)
In most buses you enter in the front, where you show your ticket to the driver, and exists from the two back doors. 

The exception to this are the A-buses (these has an red colour profile): here your can enter and exit all doors.

### Useful apps:

* Rejseplanen; plan your local transport

* DOT Ticket; Buy tickets in an app; easiest if you just get a few.

* Rejsekort; Get an anonymous Rejsekort (Similar to London Oyster card); cheaper if you travel a lot. But a hassle to get, as you cannot get it at the airport.
