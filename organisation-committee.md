# Organisation Committee
The organising committee consists of researchers from all major Danish research environments engaged in sustainable computing and related areas.


## Organisastion Chairs
  * [Maja Hanne Kirkeby](https://forskning.ruc.dk/da/persons/majaht)<br>
  Associate Professor, Roskilde University.<br>
  Expert in energy-efficient software systems and sustainable computing practices. Her research focuses on experimentally grounded methodologies for measuring and improving the energy performance of software and systems. Maja has recent experience as co-organiser of major international events, including the Dagstuhl Seminar on "Power, Energy, and Carbon-Aware Computing on Heterogeneous Systems" and the CECAM-Lorentz Workshop on "Greening AI with Software Engineering". She is responsible for the overall coordination of the symposium, including the scientific program and event execution.
  * [Michael Kirkedal Thomsen](https://di.ku.dk/Ansatte/forskere/?pure=da/persons/196082) <br>
  Associate Professor, University of Copenhagen and University of Oslo.<br>
  Expert in programming language design, models of computation, and optimization with a focus on energy and entropy constraints. His work bridges programming languages, system design, and sustainable computing. Michael is responsible for coordinating the scientific program and the engagement of international keynote speakers.
