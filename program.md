<p>
The following is a draft program outline.
</p>

## Day 1: Monday 22nd

  * 12:00 Welcome Lunch<br>
    The symposium begins with a common lunch to initiate informal interaction and networking among participants.
  * 13:30 Opening
  * 14:00 Lightning talks<br>
    Each participant gives a short introduction of their research interests and motivation for attending. This session serves as an informal ice-breaker and helps set the stage for cross-disciplinary interaction.
  * 15:00 Coffee and Cake Break
  * 15:30 Keynote Speaker #1: **Jens Malmodin**:<br>
    Evaluating the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with ICT products, networks, and services. <br>
  * 16:30 Moderated Opening Discussion
  * 17:00 Student, Doctoral, and Young Researchers forum (ICT)<br>
  Early-career researchers will present their ongoing or exploratory work. Each presentation will receive structured feedback from senior researchers, fostering valuable input and mentoring.<br>
	* <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Gudrun Gudmundsdottir*, "Modeling the Environmental Footprint of ICT Networks and Services"</span><span style="display: none;"><br>
  	The purpose of the PhD project is to develop a scientifically valid and transparent absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) model for ICT systems, aiming at laying ground for achieving absolute sustainability of ICT services. The project starts with looking at the life cycle impact and emissions of telecommunication network infrastructure (fixed and mobile), based on measured data in Sweden and Denmark through industry partnerships. By the end of year 2025 a first draft of a system model for user emissions of data transmission will be developed. State-of-the-art is embedded in the system model as well as considerations on the automation of calculations and communication/transfer of emissions between industry partners. <br>

	* <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Pascal Emmenegger*, "Designing Low-Carbon Networks Through Informed Hardware Choices"</span><span style="display: none;"><br>
	I study how hardware changes affect a network’s carbon footprint. While most studies estimate the current footprint (attributional assessment), I use consequential assessments to evaluate how today’s actions influence future emissions. With Romain Jacob (ETH Zurich), I model how adding, replacing, or removing hardware alters energy use and carbon emissions over time. The results guide operators toward lower-carbon network designs. At SUITS, I aim to refine this approach by collaborating with experts in green communications and sustainable infrastructure.  </span>

  * 09:00 Keynote Speaker #2: **Fernando Castor**<br>
    Green software development and energy-efficient system design.
  * 10:00 Coffee Break
  * 10:30 Student, Doctoral, and Young Researchers Forum (Green Software) <br>
  
    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Lise Grønland*, "Energy code smells"</span><span style="display: none;"><br>	As software systems grow in complexity and scale, energy consumption increases, and the importance of code smells grows. I will research which code smells lead to increased energy consumption. These code smells are referred to as energy code smells and contribute to energy debt. I will be addressing this problem by conducting experiments on code smells and measuring the energy consumption.  I will use both hardware- and software-based measurement tools, applied on open-source repositories using Python or Java. My aim is to compare repositories and commits, with and without energy smells.  The goal is to create a static tool that identifies and suggests energy efficient alternatives to developers.<br></span>

	* <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Simão Cunha*, "Sustainability of Local LLMs: Energy Measurement, Analysis and Optimization" </span><span style="display: none;"><br>	I'm a PhD student at the University of Minho, Portugal, working on a thesis on sustainability of local large language models. My research interests include LLMs, machine learning, and green software. My recent work includes a paper published at SLE'24 on applying CPU power caps to reduce energy consumption across programming languages while preserving performance. As a teaching assistant, I teach software development courses integrating Green Software principles and promoting sustainable coding. At SUITS, I aim to engage with fellow researchers, exchange ideas, collaborate on advancing sustainable, energy-efficient IT systems with real-world impact, and improve my skills to strengthen my PhD research.<br></span>

	* <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Brage Isak Bakkane Keiserås*, "Leveraging Energy-aware Programming"</span><span style="display: none;"><br> My research focuses on energy-efficient computing, with a particular interest in algorithms.  I am currently investigating whether GCC has become more energy-efficient throughout its evolution. This is to see if the principle of ""Compiler Optimizations Should Pay for Themselves"" holds in terms of energy, and to provide the groundwork for determining which types of compiler optimizations produce the most energy-efficient programs. Following that, I am aiming to do a similar analysis of which types of algorithms are the most energy-efficient. Overall, the goal of my research is to determine what the most energy-efficient programs are, and to create a simple yet impactful abstract model for the energy-consumption of algorithms.<br></span>

	* <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Esther Hahyeon Kim*, "From Legacy to Green Software: Energy Consumption and LLM-Enhanced Analysis"</span><span style="display: none;"><br> This study examines the energy consumption characteristics of legacy and modernized IT systems through a real-world case provided by an industrial partner, thereby contributing to research on green software. The case study evaluates an ASP.NET Web Forms–based legacy application and a system migrated to ASP.NET Core API with Angular under identical workload conditions. Furthermore, beyond mere measurement, the study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate energy data analysis and to support decision-making in modernization strategies, thereby demonstrating how intelligent tools can advance sustainable software engineering.<br></span>

## Day 3: Wednesday 24th
 
  * 09:00 Keynote Speaker #3: **Michael Welzl**<br>
    Energy-efficient networking and data transmission.
  * 10:00 Coffee Break
  * 10:30 Student, Doctoral, and Young Researchers Forum (Systems & Measurement) <br>
  
    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Nilma Abbas*, "Accuracy and Precision in Raspberry Pi 5’s Software-Reported Power Dissipation"</span><span style="display: none;"><br> This study presents initial work on evaluating the precision and accuracy of power dissipation reported by the Raspberry Pi 5. These values, originating from the on-board power management IC, capture selected internal rails but exclude 5 V input loads (e.g., USB peripherals). Reliable software-based measurement is critical for reproducible energy studies in sustainable computing, particularly for web systems requiring cross-platform comparability. In this initial study we focus on controlled CPU workloads, where device-reported values are compared against external reference measurements. The results provide an important step toward validating the Raspberry Pi 5 as a platform for software-based power measurement and assessing its suitability for sustainability research and education. <br></span>

    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Timmie Lagermann*, "Energy Analysis of UI Automation Testing Frameworks"</span><span style="display: none;"><br> We evaluate per-action energy use across four web UI automation frameworks (Selenium, Puppeteer, Playwright, Nightwatch). Because frameworks implement actions differently, their overhead can bias energy measurements; measuring at the action level under controlled conditions provides a fair basis for comparison. In a client–server environment with external power metering, we study eight common actions—refresh; left/right/double click; checkbox; drag-and-drop; text input; scroll. Results show that per-action energy differs across frameworks and actions; we quantify these effects and analyze their implications for cross-framework comparability. <br></span>

    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Judith Herrmann*, "Quantifying the Effects of RAPL Filtering" </span><span style="display: none;"><br> RAPL filtering (RAPL: Running Average Power Limit), as a counter measure to the PLATYPUS attacks, introduces noise into the believed-to-be-precise measured values on Intel platforms. In this work, we want to understand, how this artificially introduced noise impacts energy measurements. We have found, that for short code paths or snippets up to one second, the consumed energy between a filtered and unfiltered measurement can differ up to 20%. For visualizing this, we built a tool showing the gap allowing everyone to see the adverse effects on their own machine. Additionally we looked into the introduced noise to quantify and understand it better. With the help of statistical signal processing we were able to categorize the noise as Brownian noise. <br></span>

    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Samuel Xavier de Souzas*, "Holistic Software Operation for Sustainable Computing"</span><span style="display: none;"><br> The growing complexity of multicore and heterogeneous hardware has created an exponentially large software configuration space. Portable code often results in non-specialized software that requires runtime optimization for energy efficiency. Our research addresses this with a holistic approach to energy-aware software operation. We use a low-overhead combination of offline/online modeling, integrated with the OS and phase-aware techniques, to dynamically optimize configurations like thread count and NUMA mapping. This enables user-centric tools that guide applications to quasi-optimal energy points, achieving results close to an oracle solution and orders of magnitude better than worst-case scenarios. Our work contributes to energy-efficient scalable computing infrastructures. <br></span>
 
  * 12:00 Lunch
  * 13:30 Student, Doctoral, and Young Researchers Forum (AI/LLM)<br>  
  
    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Dragoș Ionescus*, "EnergyBench: A Holistic and Systematic Benchmark for Measuring the Correctness and Energy-Efficiency of LLM-Generated Code"</span><span style="display: none;"><br>	The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software development creates a paradox: while LLM-generated code can boost energy-efficiency across industries through digital transformation, their often unsupervised usage in software development has the unintended effect of generating energy-inefficient code when trading for functional correctness. This work introduces a benchmarking framework to systematically assess when and how LLMs generate energy-efficient code. Results reveal that prompt engineering can enhance code efficiency by up to 91.9% for some LLMs, but often reduces code accuracy. To address complex trade-offs and gaps, we advocate community-driven, crowdsourced benchmarking via an online platform to enable more comprehensive, empirical testing.<br></span>

    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Ehsan Yousefzadeh-Asl-Miandoabs*, "CARMA: Collocation-Aware Resource Manager with GPU Memory Estimator"</span><span style="display: none;"><br>	Deep learning (DL) training tasks often underutilize GPUs due to lack of fine-grained sharing and collocation-unaware scheduling, causing out-of-memory (OOM) failures and inefficiency. My research addresses this by designing CARMA, a resource management system that enables safe, interference-aware GPU collocation. It integrates GPUMemNet, a predictive model for estimating peak GPU memory usage, allowing informed mapping and crash recovery. This work enhances GPU utilization, reduces energy use and training time, and contributes toward sustainable and efficient DL infrastructure for shared GPU clusters.<br></span>

    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Raghavendra Selvan*, "Efficiency Is Not Enough: Toward Systems Thinking in Sustainable IT/AI" </span><span style="display: none;"><br> In this talk, I will point out why the pursuit of efficiency improvements is a necessary but not a sufficient condition when discussing sustainable IT/AI. I will point out rebound effects and how systems thinking can help advance sustainability.<br></span>

    * <span href="#" onmouseover="this.style.cursor='pointer';" onclick="toggleNext(this);" style="text-decoration: underline;color: blue;">*Michael Kirkedal Thomsen*, "EI and Energy"</span><span style="display: none;"><br> In this talk we will investigate the relation between EI and energy. What is the fundamental relation and influence does it have when we take EI to the limits?<br></span>
